This repository contains the source files for the Soccer Dashboard application.
<p>To build the application after downloading the files, perform the following steps.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Copy the entire folder/file structure into a directory on your local machine</li>
  <li><i>There is no package-lock.json file, nor a node_modules directory in the repo</i></li>
  <li>Change into the folder and run</li>
</ul>  
<p>
  <b>NPM Install</b>
</p>
<p>This will create the necessary node_modules folder and download necessary files</p>
<p>It will also create the package-lock.json file</p>
<br/>
<p><i>Once this step is done, you can run the application.</i></p>
<br/>
<p><b>NG serve --open</b></p>
